                These pie charts show the percentage of four different types of goals by sixteen teams in the round of 16 World Cup 2022. 
                Overall, it is observable that there is an overwhelming preference for assisted goals across all countries, while the occurrence of opponents' own goals is exceptionally uncommon.
                <br><br>
                The percentage of assisted goals is the majority in all countries, ranging from the lowest amount, roughly a quarter, in Poland to the entire 100% in Croatia and the United States. 
                Accordingly, this data is documented proof of the tendency to utilise collaborative gameplay, with Croatia and the US applying the most teamwork to scoring goals.
                <br><br>
                Following assisted goals, the frequency of individual goals is the second highest among the sixteen countries. 
                Representatives of this individualistic playing style are the Korea Republic and Senegal, with up to 40% of their goals being individual. 
                After that, the percentage of penalty goals is in third place. 
                It is essential to draw attention to the fact that in that year, Arsgentina broke the record for the most penalties for one team in a World Cup with five penalties. 
                Scoring four out of five penalties significantly contributed to bringing Argentina to first place in the 2022 World Cup, the second team with the highest percentage of penalty goals (26.67%). 
                That is just after Poland (33.33%), with an equal distribution of how they scored their goals in the last three mentioned goal types. 
                In contrast to the rate of other kinds of goals, opponents' own goals are rare, taking place only in Australia with a percentage of 25%.

            The three bar charts illustrate the number of total fouls and red and yellow cards per match received by teams that
            enter the Round of 16. At first glance, most teams played not too unfairly, with very few red cards per match. It is also
            apparent that the Netherlands had the most unfair style of play, with the highest stats of all variables. Meanwhile,
            Spain and England seemed to perform the best fair play in football.
            <br><br>
            With an average count of approximately 17, total yellow cards of around 2.4, and total red cards of 0.2, the
            Netherlands has surged ahead, highlighting their too-competitive play style throughout the tournament. Argentina
            had also secured the position as the team with the third-highest total fouls and the second-highest number of total
            yellow cards per match. Argentina was considered the second-most fierce national team in the World Cup without
            any red cards because red cards rarely appeared.
            <br><br>               
            In contrast, Spain and England recorded the lowest statistics of unfair play. These two countries noticeably created a
            big gap with the rest of the countries in the number of yellow cards. While England only reported an average of 1
            yellow card per 5 matches, Spain would need about two games to receive a punishment like that.

                The following box plots depict the possession distribution of the top 16 teams in the 2022 World Cup. 
                <br><br>  
                Most teams ranged their median possession rate from 40% to 60%, suggesting a balanced approach to most teams' possession. However, there were also cases of national teams that needed to be more dominant and flexible. There were 11 teams within the range of 40% to 60%. This list included most of the top-ranking countries and the 3 out of 4 teams that entered the semi-finals (Argentina, France, and Croatia). This showed the trend of each team trying to possess the ball with their opponents. This suggested that dominance in game tempo and flow was not the only aspect influencing the match's result. Spain had the most excellent median possession rate (72%). The country attempted to take over the game with persistent ball control, with the highest recorded rate of about 78%. This was more than fivefold the lowest possession rate, less than 15%. Despite having the lowest median - only around 28% - Japan holds the most extensive possession range among the 16 teams. The wide range of possession percentages for Japan (from 8% to 47%) indicates that Japan's possession varied significantly throughout the matches. Also, two of the four top teams that year, Argentina and Morocco, followed Japan in this trend. This suggested that the gameplay of some teams might have been more flexible than other teams, with high and low possession instances.
                <br><br>
                Specific teams' boxplots, such as those of the Netherlands, England, and Portugal, had relatively limited ranges. These results demonstrated a strictly consistent possession rate over matches, which relates to the players' tactical discipline and technical ability to carry out the game plan. However, there were several matches when their possession rate unexpectedly increases or decreases compared to their medians, resulting in some outliers outside the main box. These outliers could vary based on which opponents force those teams to adjust their style of play.

            The line plots illustrate the average number of forced turnovers and switches of play for the 16 best teams in the World Cup 2022.
            <br><br>
            On the one hand, the mean number of forced turnovers varies significantly, ranging from 58 to 91, which is somewhat more
            significant than the switches' mean. The highest turnover mean was nine times the highest switches mean. That proved that
            the 16 most competitive World Cup 2022 teams had comparable abilities to press their opponents rather than escape that
            pressure.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, while maintaining a consistent line throughout, the number of play switches revealed a four-times
            difference between the highest team (Korea Republic with 12) and the lowest team (Japan with 3). Another noteworthy aspect
            is that Argentina, the competition's champion, and France, the runner-up, had meager force-a-turnover ratings of 5.5 and 4,
            respectively. This could be attributed to each team's tactical style of play, possibly already dominating the opposition team, so
            there was no need to overcome pressing for top-ranking countries.
            <br><br>
            Despite having the most significant average number of switches of play (12), the Korea Republic has one of the lowest statistics
            among pressing competitors (about 65). It can be explained that the Korea Republic is not considered a competitive team in
            the world football ranking. Thus, their strategy might focus on adapting to their opponents' dominant circumstances. With the
            force-a-turnover stats, Spain maintains its lead with 90 while demonstrating its strength and flexibility when their switches
            place them in the top 5 teams.
